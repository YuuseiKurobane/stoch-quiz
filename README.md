# stoch-quiz
Quiz in Kotoba Discord bot to test how many Japanese readings/kanji you know!

## Motivation.
I don't like quizzes that require 83% accuracy and just cut-off a rank range from frequency lists.

Issue 1: If you happen to know a word outside your tested band, you don't get rewarded from it.  
Issue 2: There are trivial readings of rare compounds mixed in even in higher rarities.

My quiz attempts to solve both of these problems, by increasing the scope of the quiz, but allowing more mistakes.

## Take the test!
If you pass a level, you are certified to have a high chance of knowing at least that many kanji readings.
Estimated kanji reading ability by level:  
Level 1: 89 readings (78 kanji)  
Level 2: 296 readings (249 kanji)  
Level 3: 819 readings (625 kanji)  
Level 4: 1445 readings (1005 kanji)  
Level 5: 2372 readings (1509 kanji)  
Level 6: 3585 readings (2015 kanji)

## Datasets.
Jiten: https://jiten.moe/other (Global, Yomitan)  
JmdictFurigana: https://github.com/Doublevil/JmdictFurigana

## Methodology.
Based on a model I made: The immersion-based learner.  
Assumptions:
- A learner sees words from Jiten frequency list weighted at 1/rawfreq (Zipf distribution, this is the best information that we can get)
- Kanji readings are assumed to be learnt if the learner sees a specific kanji reading 3 times. (duplicates only count as one)
- A learner can read kanji if and only if they can read all of its components (NOTE: THIS IS A STRONG, CRUDE/BAD ASSUMPTION)
- The Kanji Burden quantity is defined as the expected time until the learner is able to read the word.
- More precisely, the Kanji Burden is the Stopping time of some Stochastic process. Therefore, the quiz is named stoch (stochastic).

Approximations/Simplifications:
- weightKanjiReading_Final.csv is roughly how often a kanji gets introduced
(If you want to be accurate, you have to not separate concepts of words and readings)
- Weibull is used to find a correlation between Kanji Burden and weight kanji reading. See 3.x.10_weibull_calibrate_from_immersion.py.

## Questions.
Add `yuusei` on Discord and DM me that you want to ask me about this quiz. I will accept friend request.  
Note: I will not accept friend request if you don't DM me anything.

- Design choice questions should go to Yuusei. I'm decent at Math but I might not know everything.
- Missing files complaint or ask for help should go to Yuusei.
- Workflow related questions, heavy tech support, heavy code support should just go to some LLM such as ChatGPT. There's a limit to what I can answer. I'll try to help though, feel free to retrace my steps and improve upon this.
