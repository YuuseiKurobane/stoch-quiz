Quiz in Kotoba Discord bot to test how many Japanese readings/kanji you know!

## Motivation.
I don't like quizzes that require 83% accuracy and just cut-off a rank range from frequency lists.

Issue 1: If you happen to know a word outside your tested band, you don't get rewarded from it.  
Issue 2: There are trivial readings of rare compounds mixed in even in higher rarities.
My quiz attempts to solve the problem.

## Take the test!
If you pass a level, you are certified to have a high chance of knowing at least that many kanji readings.
